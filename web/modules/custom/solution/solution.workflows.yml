# The workflow of the solution entity.
#
# In the following workflow we have added one 'virtual' state called new.
# This state will be used when the entity is being created.
# In order for the state_machine module to ensure that
# there is at least one option for the field, it forces
# the first available state and checks its available transitions.
# Since we are implementing our own permission schema,
# we are removing the default value and we are only allowing our
# desired target states.
# The virtual state allowes to handle the initial values during a node create.
